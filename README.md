## Introduction

Well, there's not much to it yet, just some running tests.
They test a radix tree, a tokenizer for grammar files, and an incomplete
state machine constructing functions.

## How to build

You need to install the following dependencies:

* cmake: sudo apt-get install cmake
* g++: sudo apt-get install g++
* glib 2.0 dev: sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev 

Then run build.sh or test.sh
